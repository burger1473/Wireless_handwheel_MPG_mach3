Mach 3 to Smooth Stepper Ethernet Pick and Place software
====================
This application is a work in progress build to run a DIY pick and place machine via Mach3 to a SmoothStepper Ethernet control board and Arduino Mini.

Full details of this project are on my blog at http://www.briandorey.com/

The project was built under Visual Studio 2013 and you need to have Mach3 installed and add a reference to the Mach3.exe in Visual Studio

Mach3 and this application need to be run with Administrator user rights otherwise the API often crashes.
